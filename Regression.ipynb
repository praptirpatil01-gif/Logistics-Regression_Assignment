        "Ans:-\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to study the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. It represents this relationship using a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of SLR is to predict the value of the dependent variable and to understand how changes in the independent variable affect it.\n",

        "Q2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-\n",
        "The key assumptions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   The relationship between variables should be linear.\n",
        " 1.   Observations should be independent.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The variance of errors should remain constant.\n",
        "2.  Errors should be normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   There should be no extreme outliers affecting the model.\n",

        "The method of least squares is a technique used to find the best-fitting line for the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "It works by minimizing the total difference between the actual values and the predicted values. This ensures the model makes the smallest possible prediction error.\n",
